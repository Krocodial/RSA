History
fgetc, getc
  C  File input/output 
Defined in header <stdio.h>
int fgetc( FILE *stream );
int getc( FILE *stream );
Reads the next character from the given input stream. getc() may be implemented as a macro.
Parameters
stream	-	to read the character from
Return value
The obtained character on success or EOF on failure.
If the failure has been caused by end-of-file condition, additionally sets the eof indicator (see feof()) on stream. If the failure has been caused by some other error, sets the error indicator (see ferror()) on stream.
Example
Run this code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
 
int main(void)
{
    FILE* fp = fopen("test.txt", "r");
    if(!fp) {
        perror("File opening failed");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
 
    int c; // note: int, not char, required to handle EOF
    while ((c = fgetc(fp)) != EOF) { // standard C I/O file reading loop
       putchar(c);
    }
 
    if (ferror(fp))
        puts("I/O error when reading");
    else if (feof(fp))
        puts("End of file reached successfully");
 
    fclose(fp);
}
